:summary: Arduino Workshop

Next tuesday (25th) we will have a workshop to go through the absolute basics of arduino programming. The plan is to get everyone to take input from some kind of sensor, do something with it and send it to some kind of output (possibly a LED).

Lawicel donated 10 arduino-kits for the make all-festival so if you don't own a arduino you are welcome to borrow one of those for the workshop.

Preparations: Bring a laptop and install the arduino-software before the workshop (we have a really crappy internet-connection att sparvn√§stet at the moment).

As usual the workshop is free and we will start between 18:00-19:00.
