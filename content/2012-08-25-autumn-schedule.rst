Check out the awesome [http://sparvnastet.org/autumn-schedule/](schedule) for
 the autumn at Sparvn√§stet!


There will be two epic workshop series running the next couple of weeks. One on offensive computer security and one on Arduino hacking.

As always, everyone is welcome. No registration, no fees, no questions asked...

In the computer security workshop series, we will look in to topics such as network discovery, port scanning, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, wifi hacking and much, much more.

In the Arduino workshops, you get a chance to play with this fantastic micro controller platform amongst fellow hardware hackers.
