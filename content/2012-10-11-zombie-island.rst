:summary: Hack meetings on Tuesdays move to to zombie-safe island

Since it's too cold to be at Hemliga Trädgården, our current venue, we will from Tuesday (October 16th) begin meeting at the Royal Institute of Art.

This can be seen as a temporary project until we find more permanent premises. At the The Royal Institute of Art we will among other experiment with 3D printers. Since our meetings are open, we hope that students who are interested can stop by. The program will continue as previously announced:
