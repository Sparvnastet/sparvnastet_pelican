:summary: 3d Printing

We are planning to dedicate the coming months to 3d-printing.&nbsp;

Imagine a world were we can print anything. Still in early development
    the&nbsp; possibilities of 3d-printing are opening up new imaginations, lowering&nbsp; production and prototyping costs. Like the printing press revolutionized&nbsp; literacy and made way for a new world, this 3rd Industrial Revolution&nbsp; will profoundly change the way we function socially, economically, and&nbsp;&nbsp; democratically by opening up for a new kind of small scale distributed&nbsp; production. Laws on patents and intellectual property, piracy, and trade&nbsp; becomes more and more ambiguous and outdated.&nbsp;


We will use 3d-printers like RepRap and a Makerbot to explore 3d-printing, we will use Blender and Mudbox or similar programs to make 3d-models. Can we make mashups and hybrids and generatively&nbsp; create objects? What kind of awsome projects will happen?&nbsp; We will&nbsp; discuss these issues in a text seminar. We will look att 3d-scanning&nbsp; techniques like using Kinect for 3d-scanning and much more?
